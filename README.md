# pythonNacaProfileGeneratorSTL

Script which directly generate 4-digit NACA profile to .STL file in ASCII code. 
Variables: 
"foil" 
"numberOfPoints" 
"chordLength" 
"lenght" 
"angleOfAttack" 

This code is great with OpenFOAM. 

I hope in more free time to improve this script. 5-digit NACA will be next step.
